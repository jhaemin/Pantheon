# Radix Studio

Radix Studio is an open-source WYSIWYG web design editor with real-time interaction and code generation.

The main goal is to destroy the barrier between design and development by eliminating the time and effort to convert the design to code.

[Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/) is the primary component library for the editor as you can see in the name. But any other component library or even custom components including the native DOM elements can be used.

> **Note**: It is still in development and not ready for production.

## Key Features

- **Drag and Drop**: You can drag and drop components hierarchically.
- **Real-time Interaction**: The design itself is a live component so that you can interact with the design as if it is a real web page.
- **Code Generation**: It generates TypeScript React code.

## Dev

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```
